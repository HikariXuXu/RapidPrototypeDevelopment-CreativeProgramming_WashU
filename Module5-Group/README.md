## Basic funtion
### Calendar View 
- Calendar is displayed as a table grid with days as the columns and weeks as the rows, one month at a time.
- Users can view different months as desired.

### User and Event Management 
- Events can be added, modified, and deleted.
- Events have a title, date, and time.
- Users can log into the site, and they cannot view or manipulate events associated with other users
- All actions are performed over AJAX.
- Refreshing the page does not log a user out.

## Creative Portion
- Highlight today's date: Today's date is highlighted in pink.
- More friendly page design: For the display of each month, only the days of the current month are displayed, the date of the end of the previous month and the date of the beginning of the next month will not be displayed.
- Event description function: Uses can add details of event in "body" when adding a new event. 
- Quick go:Users can use the shortcut input in the upper left corner to directly search for the date if they want to head to a distant day faster.(They can also go back to 'today' by using this shotcut)

## How to use?
- We have already created 3 usernames, they are: luna(pwd: luna123456)(Luna has added two events on July-19 and July-21), finn(pwd: finn123456)(Finn has added two events on July 23) and milo(pwd: milo123456)(Milo has added an event on July-21). And you can also create any other username and post anything new events as you wantÔºÅ
- Only after logging in, users can add, edit and delete the events.
- If users want to view their events of a specific day, they have to click the button of that day, users can see the events at the bottom of the page.
